## Note

In this course, I’ve defined my notes in the following manner. This might not be mathematically perfect way to write, but it makes it easier to read and understand.

| Meaning  | Key                |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| Constant | $p, q, a, b, A, B$ |
| Variable | $x, y$             |
| Function | $P, Q$             |

I’ve excluded function symbols to make it easier to read. For eg: $P(x) \overset{\text{written as}}{\longrightarrow} P$
