   ```mysql

   	where customer.salesman_id = salesman.salesman_id;
   ```

3. Write a SQL statement to display all those orders by the customers not located in the same cities where their salesmen live.

       	from customer, salesman
       	where customer.city != salesman.city
     );
   ```

   select ord_no as "Order Number", cust_name as Customer
   	from orders, customer
   	where orders.customer_id = customer.customer_id;
   ```

5. Write a SQL statement that sorts out the customer and their grade who made an order. Each of the customers must have a grade and served by at least a salesman, who belongs to a city.

   ```mysql
   select cust_name as Customer, grade as Grade

   		and salesman_id is not null
   	order by grade desc;
   ```

6. Write a query that produces all customers with their name, city, salesman and commission, who served by a salesman and the salesman works at a rate of the commission within 12% to 14%.

   ```mysql
   select cust_name as Customer, customer.city, salesman.name, salesman.commission as commission

   	where customer.salesman_id = salesman.salesman_id
   		and	salesman.commission between 0.12 and 0.14;
   ```

   ```mysql
   select ord_no as "Order Number", cust_name as Customer, commission as "Commission Rate", (commission * purch_amt) as "Earned Commission"
   	from orders, customer, salesman
   	where orders.customer_id = customer.customer_id
   		and orders.salesman_id = salesman.salesman_id
     	and grade > 200
   		and customer.salesman_id is not null;
   ```

   select cust_name as Customer
   from customer
   where grade > 100;
   ```

9. Write a query statement to display all customers in New York who have a grade value above 100.

   ```mysql

    select *
    from orders
    where not(
        ord_date < 2012-09-10
        and salesman_id in (select salesman_id from salesman where salesman_id <= 5005)

    	or purch_amt <= 1000;
