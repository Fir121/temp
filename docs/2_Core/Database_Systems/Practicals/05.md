**Use Joins**

1. Write a SQL statement to know which salesman are working for which customer.

   ```mysql
   select name as Salesperson, cust_name as Customer
   from salesman inner join customer
   on salesman.salesman_id=customer.salesman_id;
   ```

2. Write a SQL statement to find the list of customers who appointed a salesman for their jobs who gets a commission from the company is more than 12%.

   ```mysql
   select customer.cust_name as Customer
   from customer natural join salesman
   where salesman.commission > 0.12;
   ```

3. Write a SQL statement to find the list of customers who appointed a salesman for their jobs who does not live in the same city where their customer lives, and gets a commission is above 12%.

   ```mysql
   select distinct customer.cust_name as Customer
   from customer join salesman
   where salesman.city != customer.city
     and salesman.commission > 0.12;
   ```
   
4. Write a SQL statement to make a join on the tables salesman, customer and orders in such a form that the same column of each table will appear once and only the relational rows will come.

   ```mysql
   select *
   from salesman natural join customer natural join orders;
   ```

5. Write a SQL statement to make a list in ascending order for the customer who works either through a salesman or by own.

   ```mysql
   select customer.cust_name as Customer
   from customer
   order by customer.cust_name asc;
   ```

6. Write a SQL statement to make a cartesian product between salesman and customer i.e. each salesman will appear for all customer and vice-versa.

   ```mysql
   select *
   from customer left outer join salesman
   on customer.salesman_id = salesman.salesman_id;
   ```

Create course, prereq tables & insert the values as given in the following tables

### `course`

| course_id | title       | dept_name  | credits |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------- |
| BIO-301   | Genetics    | Biology    | 4       |
| CS-190    | Game Design | Comp. Sci. | 4       |
| CS-315    | Robotics    | Comp. Sci. | 3       |

### `prereq`

| course_id | prereq_id |
| --------- | --------- |
| BIO-301   | BIO-101   |
| CS-190    | CS-101    |
| CS-347    | CS-101    |

```mysql
use 20200198db;
set foreign_key_checks = 0;
drop table if exists course, prereq;
set foreign_key_checks  = 1;

create table course (
  course_id varchar(20),
  title varchar(20),
  dept_name varchar(20),
  credits int,
  
  primary key(course_id)
);

create table prereq (
  course_id varchar(20),
  prereq_id varchar(20),
  
  primary key(course_id, prereq_id)
##   foreign key(course_id) references course(course_id),
##   foreign key(prereq_id) references course(course_id)
);

insert into course values
("BIO-301", "Genetics" , "Biology", 4),
("CS-190", "Game Design", "Comp. Sci.", 4),
("CS-315", "Robotics", "Comp. Sci.", 3);

insert into prereq values
("BIO-301", "BIO-101"),
("CS-190", "CS-101"),
("CS-347", "CS-101");
```

7. Perform left outer join to get the following output.

   | course_id | title       | dept_name  | credits | prereq_id |
   | --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------- | --------- |
   | BIO-301   | Genetics    | Biology    | 4       | BIO-101   |
   | CS-190    | Game Design | Comp. Sci. | 4       | CS-101    |
   | CS-315    | Robotics    | Comp. Sci. | 3       | `null`    |

   ```mysql
   select *
   from course
   natural left outer join prereq;
   ```

8. Perform right outer join to get the following output.

   | course_id | title       | dept_name  | credits | prereq_id |
   | --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------- | --------- |
   | BIO-301   | Genetics    | Biology    | 4       | BIO-101   |
   | CS-190    | Game Design | Comp. Sci. | 4       | CS-101    |
   | CS-347    | `null`      | `null`     | `null`  | CS-101    |

   ```mysql
   select course_id, title, dept_name, credits, prereq_id
   from course
   natural right outer join prereq;
   ```

9. Perform full outer join to get the following output.

   | course_id | title       | dept_name  | credits | prere_id |
   | --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------- | -------- |
   | BIO-301   | Genetics    | Biology    | 4       | BIO-101  |
   | CS-190    | Game Design | Comp. Sci. | 4       | CS-101   |
   | CS-315    | Robotics    | Comp. Sci. | 3       | `null`   |
   | CS-347    | `null`      | `null`     | `null`  | CS-101   |

   ```mysql
   select *
   from course
   full join prereq;
   ## only thing that worked
   ```
