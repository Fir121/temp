1. Trigger to update the total salary of a department when a new employee is hired

   ```mysql
   drop trigger if exists update_salary_on_insert;
   
   delimiter \\
   create trigger update_salary_on_insert
   after insert on employee
   for each row
   begin
   	if new.dno is not null then
       	update deptSalary
           set totalSalary = totalSalary + new.salary
           where dnumber = new.dno;
       end if;
   end \\
   delimiter ;
   
   select * from deptSalary;
   insert into employee value(6, "Lucy", null, 90000, "1981-01-01", 1);
   select * from deptSalary;
   insert into employee values(7, "George", null, 45000, "1971-11-11", null);
   select * from deptSalary;
   ```

2. Trigger to update the total salary of a department when an employee tuple is modified
   (Adding/subtracting the difference is not safe, as there may be cases where the employee shifts to different department)

   ```mysql
   drop trigger if exists update_salary_on_update;
   
   delimiter \\
   create trigger update_salary_on_update
   after update on employee
   for each row
   begin
   	if old.dno is not null then
       	update deptSalary
           set totalSalary = totalSalary - old.salary
           where dnumber = old.dno;
       end if;
       if new.dno is not null then
       	update deptSalary
           set totalSalary = totalSalary + new.salary
           where dnumber = new.dno;
       end if;
   end \\
   delimiter ;
   
   select * from deptSalary;
   update employee set salary = 100000 where id = 6;
   select * from deptSalary;
   ```

3. Trigger to update the total salary of a department when an employee tuple is deleted

   ```mysql
   drop trigger if exists update_salary_on_delete;
   
   delimiter \\
   create trigger update_salary_on_delete
   before delete on employee
   for each row
   begin
   	if old.dno is not null then
       	update deptSalary
           set totalSalary = totalSalary - old.salary
           where dnumber = old.dno;
       end if;
   end \\
   delimiter ;
   
   select * from deptSalary;
   delete from employee where id = 6;
   select * from deptSalary;
   delete from employee where id = 7;
   select * from deptSalary;
   ```
