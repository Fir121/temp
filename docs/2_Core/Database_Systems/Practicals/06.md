Use the sample database named `sakila` and its tables in MySQL Workbench for this week’s lab. Create views for the following queries. Name of the view should be in the format “V1_YourStudentID” for the first query. (For ex. V1_2019A7PS0001).
You can view the list of tables in the sakila database using ‘Show tables’ as given in the following screenshot.

```mysql
use sakila;
show tables;
```

1. Create a view to find all actors whose last name contain the letters *GEN*.

   ```mysql
   drop view if exists ActorGEN;
   
   create view ActorGEN as
   select first_name as 'First Name', last_name as 'Last Name'
   from actor
   where last_name like "%GEN%";
   
   select * from ActorGEN;
   ```

2. Create a view to display the country_id and country columns of the following  countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and China using `in`.

   ```mysql
   drop view if exists countriesView;
   
   create view countriesView as
   select country_id, country
   from country
   where country in ("Afghanistan", "Bangladesh", "China");
   
   select * from countriesView;
   ```

3. Create a view to List each film and the number of actors who are listed for that  film. Use tables film_actor and film. Use inner join.

   ```mysql
   drop view if exists filmActors;
   
   create view filmActors as
   select title as 'Film', count(actor_id) as 'Number of Actors'
   from film
   	inner join film_actor
   	on film.film_id = film_actor.film_id
   group by film.film_id;
   	
   select * from filmActors;
   ```

4. Create a view to List the last names of actors, as well as how many actors have  that last name.

   ```mysql
   drop view if exists actorLastNames;
   
   create view actorLastNames as
   select last_name as 'Last Name', count(last_name) as 'No of People'
   from actor
   group by last_name;
   
   select * from actorLastNames;
   ```

5. Create a view to List last names of actors and the number of actors who have  that last name, but only for names that are shared by at least two actors

   ```mysql
   drop view if exists actorLastNamesIDK;
   
   create view actorLastNamesIDK as
   select last_name as 'Last Name', count(last_name) as 'No of People'
   from actor
   group by last_name
   having count(last_name) >= 2;
   
   select * from actorLastNamesIDK;
   ```

6. Create a view to display the first and last names, as well as the address, of each staff member. Use the tables staff and address. Use Join.

   ```mysql
   drop view if exists staffStuff;
   
   create view staffStuff as
   select first_name as 'First Name', last_name as 'Last Name', 
   address as 'Address'
   from staff
   	inner join address
   	on staff.address_id = address.address_id;
   	
   select * from staffStuff;
   ```

7. Create a view to Use subqueries to display all actors who appear in the film  *Alone Trip*.

   ```mysql
   drop view if exists AloneTripActors;
   
   create view AloneTripActors as
   select concat(first_name, " ", last_name) as Actor
   from actor
   where actor.actor_id in (
   	select film_actor.actor_id
     from film_actor
     where film_actor.film_id = (
       select film.film_id
       from film
       where title = "Alone Trip"
     )
   );
   
   select * from AloneTripActors;
   ```

8. Create a view to Display the most frequently rented movies in descending order.

   ```mysql
   drop view if exists FreqRentedMovies;
   
   create view FreqRentedMovies as
   select title as 'Film', count(rental_id) as 'Number of Rentals'
   from film
   	inner join inventory
   	on inventory.film_id = film.film_id
   	inner join rental
   	on rental.inventory_id = inventory.inventory_id
   group by title
   order by count(rental_id) desc;
   
   select * from FreqRentedMovies;
   ```

9. Create a view to Write a query to display for each store its store ID, city, and country.

   ```mysql
   drop view if exists StoreView;
   
   create view StoreView as
   select store_id as 'Store ID', city as City, country as Country
   from store
   	inner join address
   		on address.address_id = store.address_id
   	inner join city
   		on city.city_id = address.city_id
   	inner join country
   		on country.country_id = city.country_id;
   
   select * from StoreView;
   ```

10. Drop any of the views you created.

    ```mysql
    drop view StoreView;
    ```
