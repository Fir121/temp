## Parts of Table

Rows - Records/Tuples

Columns - Fields/Attributes

## Drawbacks of File System (Spreadheets)

1. Data redundancy and inconsistency
   1. duplication of information in different files
   2. different file formats
2. Difficulty in accessing data
3. Data isolation
   1. multiple files (scattered all over the place)
4. Integrity problems
   Data validation and constraints is difficult
5. Collaboration is difficult
6. Uncontrolled Access
7. Security Problems

## Abstraction

Data hiding

| Level of Abstraction |                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Physical Level       | describes how record is stored                               |
| Logical Level        | describes what data is stored, and the relationship between data |
| View Level           | describes information hiding                                 |

## View of data

## IDK

Schema is the skeleton of the table (without data)

Instances is the content of the table (similar to tuples)

## Entity-Relationship Model

Entity is a table

Relation is the primary key??
