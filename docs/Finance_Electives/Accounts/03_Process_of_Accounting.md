Record of transactions, regardless of income, expenses, etc

| Date       | Particulars                      | Debit(Dhs) | Credit(Dhs) |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | -------- | --------- |
| 2022-01-01 | Cash A/C Dr.                     | 20,000   |           |
|            | To Capital A/C                   |          | 20,000    |
|            | (Being commencement of business) |          |           |

To means: ==Debitor(Dr.) is **indebted** to Creditor(Cr.)==

### Purpose

- provides permanent record
- provides information of debit and credit in an entry and an explanation
- reduces the possibility of error as both aspects of a business transaction are written side by side

### Compound Journal Entries

| Date       | Particulars                | Debit (Dhs)| Credit(Dhs) |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | -------- | --------- |
| 2022-01-01 | Cash A/C Dr.               | 20,000   |           |
|            | To Electricity Company     |          | 10,000    |
|            | To Water Company           |          | 10,000    |
|            | (Expenditure on Utilities) |          |           |

==Transactions involving Discount A/C are always compound journal entries==

## Trial Balance

List of **overages** of the ledger accounts at a particular point of time

The selected side (debit/credit) is the one having the amount brought down to next period.

If everything is right, the trial balance should result in
$$
\sum \text{Debit Overages} = \sum \text{Credit Overages}
$$

| S. No | Name of A/C | Debit (Dhs) | Credit (Dhs) |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ |
