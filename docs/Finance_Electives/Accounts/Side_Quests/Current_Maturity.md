> Will long-term borrowings will be reclassified into short-term borrowings?

By: Ahmed Thahir, 2020A7PS0198U

## Summary

No, not exactly. However, long-term borrowings will be reclassified into current liabilities (not exactly short-term borrowings) upon a certain date, using the concepts of

- Current Maturity of Long-Term Debt
- Current Portion of Long-Term Debt

## Explanation

The current maturity of a company’s long-term debt refers to the stage when a long-term debt (or a portion of it) is due within the next 12 months.

Current Portion of Long-Term Debt (CPLTD) refers to the portion of liabilities that have gone throught current maturity of long-term debt. It can be less than or equal to the Long-term Debt (LTD).

0 \le \text{CPLTD} \le \text{LTD}

This means that portion of long-term debt that is to be paid within a year is reclassified from a non-current liability to a current liability.

## Why?

This is to accurately analyze the liquidity of a company, since CPLTD must be paid within the coming year; liquidity is a company's ability to convert assets to cash or acquire cash—through a loan or money in the bank—to pay its liabilities/obligations within the current year.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Current Ratio} &= \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} \\
&= \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Short-Term Borrowings + \textcolor{hotpink}{CPLTD}}} \\
\text{Quick Ratio} &= \frac{\text{Current Assets - Inventories}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} \\
&= \frac{\text{Current Assets - Inventories}}{\text{Short-Term Borrowings + \textcolor{hotpink}{CPLTD}}} \\
\text{Cash Ratio} &= \frac{\text{Cash \& Cash Equivalent + Short-Term Investments}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} \\
&= \frac{\text{Cash \& Cash Equivalent + Short-Term Investments}}{\text{Short-Term Borrowings + \textcolor{hotpink}{CPLTD}}}
\end{aligned}
$$
As you can see in all forms of liquidity analysis, we need to include CPLTD to ensure an accurate analysis.
