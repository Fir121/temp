## Accounting Concepts

|                     |                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Money Measurement   | All transactions are recorded in terms of currency (monetary value)<br />Only money transactions are recorded |
| Business Entity     | A corporation is considered as a separate legal entity from its owners |
| Dual Aspect         | Assets = Liabilities + Capital<br />(Assets + Expenses = Liabilities + Equity + Revenue) |
| Going Concern       | Assumption that business will continue to trade for the foreseable future<br />Allows cost of purchases to be distributed across time |
| Historical Cost     | Assets are quantified by their cost & not their market value |
| Accounting Period   |                                                              |
| Matching Cost       | When calculating net income, only relevant revenue and relevant expenses for the specific accounting period should be used |
| Revenue Realisation | Sale should be considered as complete only after complete exchange of ownership between both parties, for the goods/services |

## Accounting Conventions

|                 |                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Full Disclosure | All information should be informed to users of statements    |
| Materiality     | Only those information should be stated that impacts the decision of the users of statement and unnecessary information should not be disclosed |
| Conservatism    | Incorporate anticipated losses, but not anticipated profits  |
| Consistency     | Transactions/events are recorded in the same way, in every accounting period |

## Derivation of Accounting Equation

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Assets} &= \underbrace{\text{Liabilities + Capital}}_\text{Total Liabilities} \\
\text{Capital} &= \text{Equity+Net Margin} \\
\text{Net Margin} &= \text{Revenue-Expenses} \\
\implies \text{Assets + Expenses} &= \text{Liabilities + Equity + Revenue}
\end{aligned}
$$

- Capital: Soft Contract
- Liabilities: Hard Contract

## Something
