Disclaimer: Explanations are my understanding. Not economic explanations

1. (a) $E(u_i) = 0$
   This is because, only if this is the case, the line will pass through the center of the sample points
2. (d) All
   Figure out on your own
3. (b) $\beta_1 - \beta_2P + \beta_3 P^2 + u$
   We need a squared-term, so that we get a U-Shaped graph
4. (a) Uni-directional
   This question is only about the direction of relationship between the variables; not the magnitude. Sir asked in the question the nature of **this specified** relationship. not what i would choose.
5. (a) $E[Y|X_i]$
   Check textbook
6. (d) Random changes in $y$
   Check textbook
7. (c) $P_t = \alpha_2 A + e_i$
   This is because, there is no error term
8. (d) output level of various firms
   because in regression, we assume that the dependent variable is random
9. (c) are perfect/exact approximates for $\beta_1, \beta_2$
   because there is no error
10. (b) The quantity demand will increase by 0.2 unite when $P_\text{cok}$ increases by 1 unit, on average
