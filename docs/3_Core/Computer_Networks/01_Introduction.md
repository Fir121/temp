## Data Communication

Exchange of data b/w devices via transmission medium, where data is information presented in form agreed by involved parties. Termed from ‘telecommunication’ - communication at a distance

### Components of Data Communication

- Message
- Sender
- Sending protocol
- Medium
- Receiver
- Receiving protocol

### Node

Device capable of sending/receiving data to/from other notes on network

## Network

Set of devices connected by communication links

### Purpose

Share resourcces

- File sharing
- Hardware sharing
- Application sharing: Client/server apps
- Network graming
- User Commuication
  - Voice over IP (VoIP): allows calls over traditional IP rather than by traditional PTSN

### Distance-Based Classification

|      | Range                        | Example      |
| ---- | ---------------------------- | ------------ |
| LAN  | Short                        | Wifi         |
| MAN  | Specific area (city, campus) | Cable TV     |
| WAN  | Long                         | The Internet |

### Parts of Network

| Part              | Role                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ‘The Internet’    |                                                              |
| Router            | Connect internet to ‘The Internet’<br />has intelligence<br />(represented using $\otimes$) |
| Firewall          | Rules to adhere on which messages to be allowed              |
| Switch            | Helps form a LAN (Local Area Network)<br />No of ports will always be $2^n$ |
| File Server       |                                                              |
| Database Server   |                                                              |
| File Server       |                                                              |
| WiFi Access Point | kinda like a wireless switch<br />connected to wired swetch  |

Links between one/more routers should be a ‘dedicated link’

## Subnet Mask

This is the value to perform `and` operation

To get the value, just make the network bits of the IP address as 1s and host bits as 0s
