Applications are the entities that communicate with each other to exchange services

To make any use of the Internet, application programs should run on the two endpoints of a network connection

- “*Client*” applications request service
- “*Server*” applications provide service

A socket is one end of an inter-process communication channel.

## Client Server Model

Many-to-One

![image-20230531080409830](./assets/image-20230531080409830.png)

| Server                                                       | Client                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Run all the time (i.e. infinite)<br/>Provide service to any client<br/>Usually specialize in providing certain type of service, e.g. Mail<br/>Listen to a well-known port and passively open connection. | Run when needed, then terminate (i.e. finite)<br/>Actively open TCP or UDP connection with Server’s socket |

- Client needs to know existence & address of server 
- However, the server does not need to know the existence or address of the client prior to the connection
- Once a connection is established, both sides can send and receive information

### Connection Establishment

- Both client and server will construct a socket
- The process to establish a socket on the client side is different from the process to establish a socket on the server side

## P2P (Peer-to-Peer) Model

Every node in the network acts alike

![image-20230531080922328](./assets/image-20230531080922328.png)

### Advantages

- No central point of failure
- Scalability

- Since every peer is alike, it is possible to add more peers to the system and scale to larger networks

### Disadvantages

- Decentralized coordination; How to keep global state consistent?
- All nodes may not be equal

  - Computing power
  - Bandwidth

## HTTP

HyperText Transfer Protocol

- HTTP 1.0: RFC 1945
- HTTP 1.1: RFC 2068 (persistent TCP)

Used for Client-Server model

- Client: Browser request & receive Web objects
- Server: Web server sends objects in response to requests

### Properties

- Uses TCP
  - 
- “Stateless”
  - A ‘state’ is information kept in memory
    of a host, server or router to reflect
    past events: such as routing tables,
    data structures or database entries
  - HTTP server maintains no information about past client requests
  - Protocols that maintain “state” are complex!
    - history (state) is maintained
    - if server/client crashes, views of “state” may be inconsistent, must be reconciled
    - state is added via ‘cookies’
