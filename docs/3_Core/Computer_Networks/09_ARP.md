Address Resolution Protocol

Obtain MAC Address from IP address

It is ‘plug-and-play’, as nodes create their ARP tables w/o intervention from network admin

## ARP Procedure

Let’s say node A wants to send message to node B

1. Check ARP Table for B’s MAC address using IP address.
2. If B found, A sends message to B. Stop
3. Else, A **broadcasts** ARP query packet, containing B's IP address
   - dest MAC address = $FF \ FF \ FF \ FF \ FF \ FF$
   - all nodes on LAN receive ARP query
4. B receives ARP packet, replies to A with its (B's) MAC address
   frame sent to A’s MAC address (**unicast**)
5. A adds B’s mac address to its ARP table
6. Go to step 1

| ARP Message Type | Type      |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| ARP Request      | Broadcast |
| ARP Reply        | Unicast   |

## ARP Table

Each IP node on LAN has ARP table, which contains

| IP Address | MAC Address | TTL                                                          |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|            |             | Time To Live<br />Time after which address mapping will be forgotten<br />Usually 20min |

## ARP Packet

Destination address of the frame will be all 1s, as this will be broadcast
