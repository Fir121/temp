## Collision

When 2 nodes transmit concurrently

## Carrier-Sensing

When the energy level is higher than usual, that means that there is a collision

However, this method may not suitable for wireless transmission, due to energy loss.

## Persistence Methods

|                     | 1-persistent                                                 | Non-persistent                                               | $p$ - persistent                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|                     | Default persistent method                                    |                                                              | Probabilistic mixture of 1-persistent & non-persistent<br />Assume channels are slotted<br />One slot = contention period (one RTT)<br />Used when time slot duration $\ge$ max $T_P$ |
| Steps               | 1. Sense channel<br />2. if idle, transmit immediately<br />3. If busy, keep listening | 1. Sense channel<br />2. If idle, transmit immediately<br />3. If busy, wait random amount of time and sense channel | - When station ready to send, it senses the channel<br/>- If channel is idle, transmits with probability $pp$<br/>- If channel is busy, station waits until next slot.<br />- With probability $q=l-p$, the station then waits for beginning of next slot <br/>- If next slot also idle, either transmit/wait again with probabilities $pp$ & $q$ <br/>- Process repeated till either frame transmitted/another station starts transmitting<br/>- If another station  transmits, station waits random amount of time & starts again |
| If collision occurs | Wait ranom amount of time & start over                       | Wait random amount of time & start over                      |                                                              |
