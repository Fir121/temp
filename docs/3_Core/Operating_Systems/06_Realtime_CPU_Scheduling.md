## Realtime Systems

Realtime processes exist along normal processes, and their tasks are of higher priority $\implies$ Latency should be minimized

In this course, we are assuming that all realtime tasks are periodic, ie task repeats itself at regular intervals of time

## Types of Realtime Systems

|                              |    Soft Realtime System    |                     Hard Realtime System                     |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| Strict deadline constraints? |             ❌              |                              ✅                               |
| Deadline miss leads to       | Degradation in performance |                     failure/destruction                      |
| Bounded Latency?             |             ❌              |                              ✅                               |
| Example                      |      Streaming Video       | Robots in medical treatment<br />Automated chemical plant<br />Auto-missile system |

## Types of Latency

- Interrupt latency
- Dispatch latency
- Event latency

## Terms

| Term                  | Symbol | Meaning                                                      |
| --------------------- | :----: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Execution Time        |  $t$   | Time taken for a process to complete execution               |
| Time Period           |  $p$   | The interval at which the process has to repeat itself<br/>(not like time quanta in Round Robin) |
| Deadline              |  $d$   | Time constraint for execution time $:d \le p$<br />In this course, we are assuming that $d = p$ |
| Processor Utilization |  $U$   | Fraction of utilization of available processor resources<br />$U = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \frac{t}{p}$, where $n=$ number of tasks |

## Scheduling Algorithms

Algorithms to complete a set of $n$ tasks, using a single processor, such that

- $d=p$
- $t =$ constant

CPU utilization is not always 100%. It is bounded to a limit, based on number of tasks in system
