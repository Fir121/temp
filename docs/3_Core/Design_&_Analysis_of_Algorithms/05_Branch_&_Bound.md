Algorithm that is used for solving combinatorial optimization problems, which usually have exponential time complexity.

All children of the E-node are generated before any other live node can become the E-node

Bounding functions are used to help avoid the generation of sub trees that do not contain an answer node

## Types

1. DFS (Stack/FIFO)
2. BFS (Queue/LIFO)
3. Least cost branch and bound

In both LIFO and FIFO types, the selection rule for the next E-node is rigid, resulting in exploring maximum of all the E-nodes consuming more time.

## Least Cost Branch & Bound

Selection of E-node is based on a cost function

Not all the children of a node is generated; only nodes with least cost are expanded

If we are close to the solution, first explore that path completely, instead of partially exploring other paths.

### Cost Function

If Cost measure is used

- search would always generate the minimum number of nodes 
- only nodes to become E-nodes are the nodes on the path from the root to the nearest answer node

The difficulty with using the "ideal" cost functions is that computing the cost of a node will usually involve a search of the subtree X for an answer node.

Hence, by the time the cost of a node is determined, that subtree has been searched and there is no need to explore X again. 

For this reason, search algorithms usually rank nodes based only on an estimated value, ĝ(), of their cost.

#### Formula

$$
\hat c(x) = f\Big(h(x)\Big) + \hat g(x)
$$

where

- $f(x)$ is a non-decreasing function
- $h(x)$ is cost reaching $x$ from root
- $\hat g(x)$ is estimated additonal effort  to reach answer node from $x$
  - $\hat g(y) \le \hat g(x)$, if $y$ is a child of $x$
