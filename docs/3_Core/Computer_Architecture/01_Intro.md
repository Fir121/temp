### Microprogram

It is a microinstruction program that controls the functions of a central processing unit or peripheral controller of a computer

Microcode is low-level code that defines how a microprocessor should function when it executes machine-language instructions. 

Typically, one machine-language instruction translates into several microcode instructions

## ISA

Instruction Set Architecture

Interface between hardware and lowest level of software

Includes information necessary (instructions, registers, memory access, I/O, and so on) to write a machine language program that will
run correctly

### ABI

Application Binary Interface

Combination of the basic instruction set and the operating system interface
