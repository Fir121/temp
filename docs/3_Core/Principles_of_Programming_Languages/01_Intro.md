## Programming Lanugage

Tool for humans to communicate with a computer system

We should try to generalize a programming language, to ensure compatibility.

### Properties

- Turing Complete
  Must be able to express anything computable 
- Must be able to implement on existing hardware platforms

### What makes a good language?

- Syntax close to what we are used to
- Readability
- Expressibility
  For eg, `while ` loop instead of `if` and `goto`
- Reliability: Error Checking
    - Detect use of initialized variables
    - Type checking
    - Array Bounds (C vs Java)
    - Testing Support

## Paradigms

|                               | Imperative                                                   | Declarative                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Programmer tells __ to do     | how                                                          | what                                                         |
| Focus of programming language | Do exactly what is told                                      | Do what is meant                                             |
| Classifications               | - **Procedural**: Fortran, C<br />- **Object-Oriented**: C++, Java<br />- **Scripting**: Python, Javascript, Bash(Shell) | - **Functional**: LISP/Scheme/Haskel, symbolic data processing<br/>- **Logic**: Prolog, Logic Reasoning<br/>- **SQL**: mySQL, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, NoSQL |
|                               |                                                              | - Sequential<br/>- Concurrent                                |

### Why do we usually use imperative languages?

As we mainly use von [Neumann machines](#von-Neumann-Architecture), which is the class of stored program digital computer.

Imperative languages give control over moving data and program instructions between registers in CPU and Memory location

### von Neumann Architecture

There is no distinction between code and data, as they are stored in the same memory

### Structured Programming

Dijkstra

Also referred to as ‚Äògoto-less‚Äô programming

- Single entry, Single exit sequence
- Selection
- Repetition

In the present-day, compiler-generated code is faster than human-written assembly code; it was not the case before

## Bugs

### Solution

- Organize code modularly, such that each part can be understood
- Alpha Testing by company testers
- Beta Testing by end-users

## Scripting Language vs Programming Language

Programming languages

- follow EBNF(Extended Bacus Normal Form)
- have CFG(Context-Free Grammar)

### Compiled Code

```mermaid
flowchart LR

subgraph "Once"
  sp2[Source Program] --> Compiler
end

Compiler -->  tp2

subgraph "Every Execution"
	tp2[Target Program]
	i2[/Input/] --> tp2 --> o2[/Output/]
end
```

### Interpreted Code

```mermaid
flowchart LR

subgraph "Every Execution"
	direction LR
  sp2[Source Program] --> Interpreter
  i1[/Input/] --> Interpreter --> o2[/Output/]
end
```

### Virtual Machines

```mermaid
flowchart LR

subgraph "Once"
  sp2[Source Program] --> Compiler --> ip["Byte Code<br />(Intermediate Program)"]
end

ip --> vm[Virtual Machine]

subgraph "Every Execution"
	i2[/Input/] --> vm --> o2[/Output/]
end
```

combine the plus points of compiler/interpreter

Interpreting high level code is slow

### Java

```java
javac Prog.java
java Prog
```

#### Python

```python
python prog.py
```

- First time the program is run, it is interpreted
- In subsequent runs, the cached byte code `.pyc` is executed
## RAM

Random Access Memory

Stores program instructions, addresses, and immediate values

## Shell Scripts

```bash
ls | sort | more
```
