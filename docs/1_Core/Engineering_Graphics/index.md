# Engineering Graphics

This course has two parts, Part - 1 (for midsem) includes orthographic projections, isometric projections and straight lines. Part - 2 (for compre) includes projection of lines + solids, sectional view of solids and cutting of solids. 

A problem set wiith questions from the textbook are given a week before midsems and compre which are really helpful for preparation. The solutions to those problems have been provided by this junior's repository [SivaaB/BITSPil-CSF111](https://github.com/SivaaB/BITSPil-CSF111). Thank you Sivaa! âœ¨
