## Steps in biology to conclude a statement:

Observation, Question, Hypothesis, Prediction, Experiment.
(convert this into mermaid flowchart)
If the experiment does not support hypothesis then make a new one. If it supports hypothesis, make new predictions. 

### Mnemonic for remembering: [OQHPE]
1. **O**bservation
2. **Q**uestion
3. **H**ypothesis
4. **P**rediction
5. **E**xperiment


## Major life charecteristics

Order, Regulation, Growth and Development, Energy Processing, Response to Environment, Reproduction, Evolution. 

### Mnemonic for remembering: [ORGERRE]
1. **O**rder
2. **R**egulation
3. **G**rowth and Development
4. **E**volution
5. **R**esponse to Environment 
6. **R**eproduction 
7. **E**volution

## Major themes in biology

Energy Processsing, Structure and Function, Information Flow, Evolution, Interconnection to other systems. (Pnemonic : ESIEI)

### Mnemonic for remembering: [ESIEI]
1. **E**nergy Processing
2. **S**tructure and Function
3. **I**nformation Flow
4. **E**volution
5. **I**nterconnection to other systems.

#### Eubacteria: 

- Small, Prokaryotic, Single celled organisms ranging from 1 - 10um. 
- Lack nucleus and cell membrane bound organelles. 
- Cell wall contains a complex organic molecule called peptidoglycan. 

#### Archea: 

- Prokaryotic
- Cell membrane has Isoprenes. 
- Extremophiles 
- Has large proportions of genes that are diff from eubacteria.

Protists : Microscopic Organisims like Amoeba and Seaweed.

Kingdoms are distinguished as: 
- Plantae : Produce their own food. 
- Animalia : Obtain food by ingesting and digesting. 
- Fungi : Decomposers, obtain food by decomposing dead and decaying organic matter. 

Prokaryotes have: 
- Pilli : Short projections for attachment to surfaces. 
- Flagella : Long projections to propel them through their liquid environment. 
- Capsules : Makes the bacteria's surface more slippery, helping it to escape engulfment by phagocytic cells.

Only Animal cells have Lysomes and Plant Cells have Chloroplasts.
