## China's rise

### Reason china is getting better so quickly

Because they aren't wasting their money unnecessarily on military endeavors, like the US

### Why isn't India rising so quickly

In india, the govt just focuses on implementing policies so as to gain enough popularity to win the next election. hence the policies are always short-sighted, because the ruling party knows that if it makes good long term policies instead of short term, they will lose the next elections and all the benefits of their policies will actually be enjoyed by their successors.

meanwhile, in china, there is only one 'communist' party (which isn't exactly communist), which is always the ruling party; hence, it makes very long term policies

### Military

Not even close to US in terms of physical military

Trying to attack digitally

#### But why does US still spend so much on military

because, that is the only superiority it has over countries. If it loses this advantage, then all the countries that are dependent on it for military purposes might go away

### Allies

Not many allies compared to US

## Quad vs AUKUS

Both are groups of countries against China

| Quad                                                         | AUKUS                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| US                                                           | US                                                           |
| Australia                                                    | Australia                                                    |
| Japan                                                        | UK                                                           |
| India                                                        |                                                              |
| Not much progress, as Japan and China do not want to invite animosity from China; if they join, then they'll get stuck with it | Anti-China nuclear submarine alliance; gained more progress than the Quad | Australia joining the AUKUS triggered france, because france was dependent on australia to buy submarines from them|

Terrorism is more a tactic of the weak, rather than of the strong.

## How regional conflicts affect international relations

### Kurdish-Turkish Conflict

The Kurdish–Turkish conflict is an armed conflict between the Republic of Turkey and various Kurdish insurgent groups who have either demanded separation from Turkey to create an independent Kurdistan, or attempted to secure autonomy and greater political and cultural rights for Kurds inside the Republic of Turkey

It is concerning for other countries as they are scared that the kurds in their own country would start asking for a state of their own

### India-Sri Lanka Conflict

India interfered in the domestic aspects of Sri Lanka, and instigated a conflict, which ended up being an international conflict

Fear in pakistan about nuclear weapons cuz of fear that it will fall under the wrong hands like terrorists

1. Even in india and pak’s case in war, india would always be limited in its strategic decisions. india doesn’t want the wrong people to get hold of the ruins and the nuclear weapons
2. pakistan could just take out the political sphere in order to knock india out, but it can’t because it wants to avoid a new govt that is more against it, and to avoid a headless chicken in charge of the neighboring enemy

## Cooperation

according to realists, cooperation takes place only as long as it benefits yourself; otherwise, the cooperation breaks off

liberals say that once cooperation starts, laws and treaties are to be established to ensure it doesn’t break

### IAEA

international atomic energy agency

the treaty said that nuclear for energy is fine, but the thingies shouldn’t be used for military

### Biological Weapons Convention (BWC)

it happens because it is not seen as a real military weapon

## Indus Water Treaty

even though they are at war, India and Pakistan realized that they shouldn’t fight for water as it is a basic human requirement

Liberals say that they is scope for cooperation even b/w countries at war
