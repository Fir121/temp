## Soft Power

- trying to change the perception of the country, without using any force
- helps in diplomatic relations
- healthier than hard power??

eg:

- US: hip hop
- Japan: anime
- Korea: KPop, KDrama

### Japan

- japan is trying to stay close allies with the US
- but doesn't always get along with them, for eg
    - Paris Climate Agreement
    - Recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel
- Japan sees China’s soft power tactics as pure propaganda
- Japan is unnotoriously closed off to outsiders
    - they’re afraid of diluting their culture
    - however, now it’s slowly changing cuz they’re afraid of the aging population

### US

Softpower has gone down, especially after the storming of the White House in Jan 2021.

### India
