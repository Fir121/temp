## North Korea

Is it more dangerous that North Korea has nuclear weapons compared to democratic countries like India??

One more reason why China getting powerful is a threat is because
it is threatening that a non-democratic country will be the one of - if not - the most powerful country.

## Indo-China

india and china had a war in 1961

China has had problems with India, because India has given asylum to the Dalai Lama.

India is trying to keep it non-violent, because

1. it is not capable to do so yet
2. it cannot, as it might lose with Pakistan in Kashmir
3. it cannot risk angering USA

What’s the point of democracy if India is censoring maps, but it’s fine??

Why do you say that a democracy better than a dictatorship?
