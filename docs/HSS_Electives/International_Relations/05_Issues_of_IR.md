## Issues of International Relations

## History of nuclear weapons

Nuclear weapons are more of a political weapons, rather than an actual military weapon; cuz it’s more about signaling/deterrence than actually using it

Nuclear weapons were only used once - when the victim did not have any nuclear weapons to deter them; ie, US on Japan; no MAD (mutually assured deterrence)

But the fact that it hasn’t been used so far doesn’t mean that it cannot happen now

Western world was caught off guard when India started nuclear testing (according to the media, at least)

Indian strategists were actually glad that Pakistan also got nuclear weapons, because Pakistan now became secure; an insecure Pakistan would try to attack India in other ways; now it’s just about deterrence, rather than fighting

This could be possible for Iran too, cuz it’s been cornered by everyone; but if it becomes nuclear, then it will become secure and may reduce terrorism

==Terrorism is the weapon of the weak== ; the strong do not do that

all this is like gun laws for civilians

### Present

All countries are allowed to have civilian nuclear programs for power generation; but the countries must sign treaties to allow inspection to ensure that nothing is get diverted into the weapon development

Iran is producing nuclear weapons to protect itself from Israel. Should we be worried?
Yes, because (the below reason)

Arguably, we should monitor which countries newly avail nuclear weapons, because we do not know how they would use them

It is better if nuclear weapons are under a civilian government, rather than the military

The permanent 5 of UN were somehow okay with India and Pakistan going nuclear, but then they are not okay with other countries cuz it changes the power balance

## Treaties

### Disarmament

Japan has been educating countries to denuclearisation

### Non-Proliferation Treaty

Stopped horizontal proliferation (no of countries)

India criticized the treaty saying that the treaty did nothing about vertical proliferation (no of weapons, trials); India said that then they should ban testing

### IDK Treaties

i don’t agree with this, but this theory says that

even the defensive missile weapons systems should be controlled so that the countries that have nuclear weapons do not feel insecure

## Elements of Stable Nuclear Deterrence

According to Scott Sagan

1. disallow pre-emptive war when one side has a temporary advantage
   1. eg: 2nd Gulf War
2. develop survivable second-strike forces
   1. to deter the enemy if they nullify the first attack
3. avoid accidental nuclear war
4. keep weapons away from terrorists

## Determinants of going nuclear

1. to improve national security
2. to improve prestige, national identity
3. to improve political image
   1. Western world wants to affect the common people of countries, so that the people riot against the country
   2. But if the country makes nuclear weapons, then it appeases the people
4. economic costs

## More vs None

what is better? more or no nuclear weapons?

### For More

helps small countries feel secure which will stop them from doing other nonsense

## Nuclear Doctrines/Postures

1. every country wants a **minimum deterrence**
2. second strike/survivable weapons capability
3. No First Use
   eg: India and China
4. assured and massive retaliation
   eg: Cold war
5. Nuclear strategy prefers counterforce
   1. Counterforce - attack military threats like missile launch points
   2. Countervalue - attack commercial places like malls, tourist destinations, wonders of the world
6. Asymmetric escalation
   not responding proportional
7. Launch on Warning (LoW)
   keep missiles and nuclear weapons separately to give the enemy some time to reconsider their current decision
8. Nuclear strategies
   1. Nuclear ambiguity/opacity
      eg: Israel
   2. latent nuclear capacity
      eg: North Korea
   3. Extended nuclear deterrence/ nuclear umbrella
      eg: US for the countries dependent on it

## Recent Developments

Countries are still keeping on increasing their nuclear weapons

we are further away from nuclear-free than ever 

### China

has been accelerating its nuclear capability

hypersonic missiles
can evade the radars of the enemy

Nuclear posture

1. defensive
2. clearly no use on nuclear-less countries

### India

india has always been no first use

despite this being a great policy for a safer world, India has recently become more ambiguous about this, saying that they might consider using it for certain circumstances to signal others not to mess with them

## Terrorism

United Nations has never been able to come up with a working definition. The definition changes with context.

### Terrorist

The govt tends to label anybody against the state as a terrorist. Kinda messed up and unfair defintion, but yeah what to do.

### KLF

Khalistan Liberation Front

Pakistan funded the movement

### Kurdistan Worker’ Party

Kurds have wanted their own state for a long time

- Why was this a threat?
- cuz other groups will also start asking for their states

But the UN did not interfere, cuz they cannot interfere in the internal affairs of a country

### IRA

Irish Republican Army

Northern Ireland wanted to separate 

### ETA

Spain - Catalonya

Basque separatists

### Why do terrorist take up arms?

1. other measures have not succeeded
2. perceived/real victimhood
3. minority persecution
4. unfair govt
5. misfits
6. sociopaths

### Terrorists

- non-state actors
- they do not differentiate bw civillians vs the govt
- for them, the end justifies the means
- in reality they’re weak

## Pathology of Terrorism

many terrorist groups in countries is funded by other countries

a lot of funding comes from diaspora and from illegal trades like fake clothing, merch, etc.

a lot of govts consider NGOs a forefront for terrorism funding

2 happenings of terrorism

1. as a method to meddle in another country’s affairs
2. as an organisation

## Tibet

China has done the following tricks in Tibet

1. intermingle the population there
2. connect the country with the rest of the country

so the average tibetan doesn’t want an independent country anymore, cuz they’re anyways happy with what they’re getting rn
