### US in Afghanistan

Afghanistan was initially dependent on the soviets. But US did not like that. Hence, it supported the Mujahidin guerillas to overthrow the govt. Then the govt was unstable and the values were against the US; then 9/11 happened. Then, the US went to intervene. I feel like US just went there to exploit the opium resources of Afghanistan

### Failure in Afghanistan

it highlights America's decline

Now, everyone's opinion of US will go down because they just spent 10-15yrs in a war (which wasn't even theirs), used up so much resources, failed and came back; and within a few weeks or so, the Taliban takes over.
