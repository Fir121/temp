This introductory page is a big long, but that's because all the below concepts are common to every upcoming topic.

## Machine Learning

Field of study that enables computers to learn without being explicitly programmed; machine learns how to perform task $T$ from experience $E$ with performance measure $P$.

Machine learning is necessary when it is not possible for us to make rules, ie, easier for the machine to learn the rules on its own

	direction LR
	r1[Standard<br/>Rules/<br/>Functions] & i1[New<br/>Input] -->

	o1[New<br/>Output]
end

## Why do we need ML?

To perform tasks which are easy for humans, but difficult to generate a computer program for it.
